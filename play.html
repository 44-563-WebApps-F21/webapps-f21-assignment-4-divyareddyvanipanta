        <p class="speech">
            The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
            else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
            shame left.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="stage-direction">[After a pause.]</p> 
        <p class="speech">
            They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you
            cough?
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            But I haven’t got a cough.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            They’re looking at us. What effrontery!
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            They’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Let us preserve a dignified silence.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Certainly. It’s the only thing to do now.

            Algernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]

        <p class="speech">
            This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            A most distasteful one.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            But we will not be the first to speak.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Certainly not.

        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends
            on your reply.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
            answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
            guardian’s brother?
        </p>
        <h5 class="name algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="stage-direction">
            [To Gwendolen.]
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does
            it not?
        </p>
        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital
            thing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for
            pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an
            opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
