        <h3>The Importance of Being Earnest, by Oscar Wilde</h3>
        <h4>
            THIRD ACT<br>
            SCENE<br>
            Morning-room at the Manor House.<br>
            [Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]<br>
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
            else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
            shame left.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            [After a pause.] They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you
            cough?<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            But I haven’t got a cough.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            They’re looking at us. What effrontery!<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            They’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            Let us preserve a dignified silence.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            Certainly. It’s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by
            Algernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            A most distasteful one.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            But we will not be the first to speak.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            Certainly not.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends
            on your reply.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
            answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
            guardian’s brother?<br>
            <br>
            <b>ALGERNON</b>.
            In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            [To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does
            it not?<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            Yes, dear, if you can believe him.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CECILY</b>.
            I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GWENDOLEN</b>.
            True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital
            thing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for
            pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an
            opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?<br>
